        <p class="mb-0">... the state's
            high prison population is no accident. An approach which began as an effort to cope with prison overcrowding
            has led to a system where more than half of the state's inmates are housed in for-profit facilities with
            financial incentives for local sheriffs to keep prisons full.

            The state's prison sentences are among the
            harshest in the country, Chang writes, and both private prison operators and the Louisiana Sheriffs
            Association lobby the legislature to keep it that way.
