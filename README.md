# Pelican Pen

A simple Reveal.js presentation on race, greed, and anguish in the Louisiana Prison System

## Motivation

I've been listening to [Ear Hustle](https://www.earhustlesq.com/) for some time and went down a research rabbit hole
about the inequities of Louisiana's criminal justice system.

This was around the time I got assigned a final project in my Louisiana History class

I wanted to take the opportunity to turn everything I was reading into an easily-digestible website

This is intended to be a **simple** quick and dirty one-off project.
So no best practices like using a templating language, front-end framework, or scss

Also, the way I populate the references page and do citation embedding is janky and not sustainable, I'm aware
